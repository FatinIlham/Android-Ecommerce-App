# Android Ecommerce App
In this project we developed an android-based software to provide all product information to the customers’ 
needs and customers will buy these products. 

For example, A customer must need’s an account to login in this app, but he/she doesn’t have any account 
than he/she needs to sign up. Then the home page will be shown. In home page there will be multiple types 
of product. There is also a search bar. A customer can search product by his/her needs. He/she can also see 
the product details and can also order these product.
